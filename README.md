An ordinary Python library is Tkinter. The quickest and simplest approach to create an object-oriented GUI application is with Python and the tkinter package.
I like to create different GUIs for my Machine learning projects. It gives me freedom of expression to communicate with my end user. Creating a GUI myself for my Machine learning Projects feels like, I am telling the story myself more than anyone else telling my story.

There are many libraries that you can use to build a GUI in Python. Some famous ones are PyQt5, Kivy, PySimpleGUI, Tkinter, etc. I have used Tkinter as it is a simple and basic GUI library that is best for beginners in my opinion. Although there are some limitations to building GUI using Tkinter when it comes to styling your GUI, I use it for quick projects.
 I find it easy to create a GUI using Tkinter and convert it to an executable and distribute it to the end user just by sharing the file. it is quick and economical in terms of time and cost.
You should have Python and Tkinter installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have Tkinter installed, you can install it using pip in Anaconda prompt:

pip install tk
